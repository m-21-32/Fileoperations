# Mini-Project 4: Asynchronous Operations and RESTful API

## Overview

This mini-project builds upon the concepts of asynchronous programming, Promises, and RESTful API development. The goal is to enhance the existing project with Promises, async/await, callbacks, and improved error handling.

## New Features and Enhancements

### 1. Promises Implementation

- Replaced traditional callbacks with Promises for asynchronous operations.
- Utilized async/await for cleaner and more readable code.

### 2. Async/Await Usage

- Refactored code to use async/await where applicable, improving code readability and maintainability.

### 3. Callbacks Example

- Demonstrated the continued use of callbacks where they are still useful.
- Provided an example illustrating the implementation of callbacks in the code.

### 4. Event Loop Understanding

- Added a section in the README explaining the Node.js event loop.
- Improved understanding of how the event loop functions in the context of the project.

### 5. Robust Error Handling

- Implemented proper error handling for all asynchronous operations.
- Ensured that error messages are informative and aid in debugging.

## Project Structure

- Updated the project structure to reflect the introduction of Promises and async/await.
- Clearly defined the use of callbacks in specific scenarios.
